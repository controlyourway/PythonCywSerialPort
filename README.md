# Python CYW Serial Port

These scripts connects a serial port to our service. This allows data to be sent from another device running one of our
libraries to any serial port that can be accessed by Python. PythonCywSerialPort_p27.py is used for Python 2.7 and
PythonCywSerialPort_p34.py is used for Python 3.4. Configure the settings.ini file before using these scripts.
